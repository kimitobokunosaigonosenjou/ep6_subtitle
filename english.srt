1
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:28,200
Lady Alice?

2
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,410
Huh?!

3
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,950
Wh-What?! I wasn't thinking about Iska at all!

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,160
Iska?

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:43,540
Ah... Um, it's not what you think, Rin.
Wh-What I meant was, um, well, you see...

6
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,200
Very well.

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,950
If you're really that interested
in the swordsman,

8
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:52,910
arranging a battle with just the two of you,
as you wish, may be for the best.

9
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,790
Huh...? You mean it?

10
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:59,370
Yes. We've already met him
three times in the Neutral city, Ein.

11
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,160
Our best bet is to
simply keep visiting that city.

12
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,040
Thank you, Rin!

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,450
Oh, I can't wait! You just wait, Iska!

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,740
Yes, I can't wait, either.

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,580
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

16
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:46,200
Boss, minus 200 points.

17
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm sorry!

18
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,040
C-Captain...

19
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,990
You don't have to apologize so much...

20
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,410
No, I really can't apologize enough...

21
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,580
You're right about that.

22
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,450
It was fatal to be captured
by Shanorotte, the spy.

23
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,370
Then, you fell into the vortex and passed out,

24
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,740
forcing Iska to jump in to save you.

25
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,990
I'm sorry for causing so much trouble...

26
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Especially to you, Iska...

27
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,370
Iska, how are you doing?

28
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,290
I'm fine.

29
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,790
So please don't worry, Captain.
I'm just glad you're okay.

30
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,740
Yeah, thanks...

31
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,200
What's wrong?

32
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,450
Is it your shoulder?
If you're in pain, I have a cold pack.

33
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:47,660
No. It doesn't hurt. It just feels weird...

34
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:55,040
Hiya, members of Unit N07! Everyone here?

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,450
Infiltrate the Nebulis Sovereignty?!

36
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,990
Uh-huh! That's the secret mission
I was talking about the other day.

37
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,040
Under my command, you'll make
your way into the Sovereignty.

38
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Your mission is to capture Queen Nebulis.

39
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,120
You're going too far with your joke,
Miss Saint Disciple.

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
It's not funny.

41
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,740
I agree.

42
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,910
It's rare for you to give
such a disapproving look, Issy.

43
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,950
I'm used to unreasonable demands,
but I really think this mission's impossible.

44
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,040
You can do it, Issy!

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,740
Besides, all the members
of this unit are talented.

46
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,450
Even so, you do have a plan, right?

47
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,080
Tell us exactly what that is. How can we
even get inside the Sovereignty?

48
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,410
They have the astral power trials.

49
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,080
You're right to point that out.

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,370
At the Empire, the astral crest of an
astral mage was used for witch trials.

51
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:54,200
The Sovereignty used that against us,
using the astral crest as a passport.

52
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,790
People without astral crests are highly
likely to be spies from the Empire,

53
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,410
so entry to the Nebulis Sovereignty
isn't easily granted.

54
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:07,490
But there is a way for people from
the Empire to infiltrate the Sovereignty.

55
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,370
What?

56
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,740
You'll find out in three days,
when we finish the prep work for the op!

57
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,990
Lady Alice, are you sure
you don't need a parasol?

58
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,200
Too much sun isn't good for you.

59
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,160
It's been three days that we've been
waiting at the square like this.

60
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,870
Yes, three days. Three days we've been
looking for Iska, and no sign of him.

61
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,790
Why isn't he here?

62
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,490
Up until now, we've always
found each other here.

63
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,240
Up until now, it was special.

64
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,450
Are you saying we're no longer special?

65
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,950
No, that's not what I meant. However...

66
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,830
If that swordsman was engulfed in
the vortex's eruption, he could be de--

67
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:02,870
He's alive!

68
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,870
Iska is alive. And he's going to fight me.

69
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,540
If you say so, Lady Alice.

70
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,160
Let's split up and look for him!
I'll search the main street.

71
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,740
Call me immediately if you find Iska!

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,370
Lady Alice, you are destined
to be our next queen.

73
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,410
Unfortunately, the Nebulis Sovereignty
is not without domestic conflict.

74
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,830
Others are watching like hawks
for an opportunity to take the throne.

75
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:48,450
Your sisters are increasing their presence
in preparation for the election.

76
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:53,830
Now is the time to be gaining more
supporters and preparing for the future.

77
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,660
You should not be so fixated
on an Imperial soldier like him.

78
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:03,160
I, Rin, shall sever your fate with Iska,
the swordsman of the Empire!

79
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:09,700
I wonder what Risya has in mind
to infiltrate the Sovereignty?

80
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,080
Who knows? It's difficult for
even Neutral city citizens to get in.

81
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,910
It should be downright impossible
for Imperial soldiers to do it.

82
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,740
Captain, is your shoulder still bothering you?

83
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,790
You get a heat rash from sleeping too much?

84
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:32,490
That's not it at all, Jhin!
Girls don't get rashes.

85
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,620
It's probably just a bug bite!

86
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,580
You're too old to be called a girl.

87
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,200
Grr! Jhin, you always say such mean things!

88
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,950
Nene, you have the meds?

89
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,160
I do. Captain, take off your jacket.

90
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,120
It's embarrassing that I have a bug bite...

91
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,240
Let's see... Ah, here it is!

92
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,700
Huh?

93
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,660
U-Um...

94
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,330
That's odd... I've never seen
such a weird bug bite...

95
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:39,910
Uh, what? What is this?
N-No, this isn't what it l-looks like...

96
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,490
Captain, it's okay.
First, you need to calm down.

97
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,790
I'm only asking, just in case,
but do you have any idea how you got it?

98
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,870
Huh? Um...

99
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,290
It has to be the vortex.

100
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,830
What you two saw right before
you were blasted off from the ground

101
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,080
was probably the astral spirit itself.

102
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,290
And it possessed Boss.

103
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,620
Ninety-nine percent of people
don't get possessed,

104
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,700
no matter how strong the astral spirit.

105
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,290
Boss, you just happened to be a "suitable host."

106
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,540
I-I've... Become... a witch...?

107
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,700
Seeing that you have an astral crest,
you hit jackpot.

108
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,240
If you want confirmation, the research institute
will have to take a look, but...

109
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
She can't do that, Jhin!

110
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,120
If the research institute finds out
she became a witch, she'll be executed!

111
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,490
If she turns herself in,
she'll only be imprisoned.

112
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:47,040
That's still bad! Without Captain, I...

113
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,410
Captain.

114
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,990
We'll follow your orders. You make the decision.

115
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:01,410
Me?

116
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,490
If you turn yourself in, you won't be executed.

117
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,200
We'll do everything we can
to get the sentence reduced.

118
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,740
You'll always be under watch, but they might
allow you to live outside the capital.

119
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,700
That's one option.

120
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:24,620
Making sure this astral crest stays hidden
and you remain as our captain...

121
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,790
That's the other option.

122
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,330
But... If we're caught,
you'll all be in trouble!

123
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,490
Don't worry about that.

124
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:45,410
We're your team. Just tell us what
you want and leave the rest to us.

125
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,040
I'm totally on board!

126
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,870
I...

127
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,830
I don't want to quit being your captain...

128
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:03,410
Especially when we finally got back together...

129
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,490
Is that... wrong?

130
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,580
No...

131
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,490
It isn't wrong.

132
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:17,950
If that's what you want, we won't leave you.

133
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,410
Thank you.

134
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,490
Ahh... There goes our third day...

135
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,790
Should we change tactics?

136
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,240
One option is to give up on Ein.

137
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,160
What are you saying, Rin?!
We can't give up now!

138
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,620
Where would Iska be...?

139
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,040
Oh, he could be here!

140
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,870
Ah, he could be here, too.

141
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,950
We're coming in.

142
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,120
How's Captain?

143
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,200
Yeah, I think she's calmed down a bit.

144
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,450
I'll spend the night with Captain tonight.

145
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,200
That's good. But her astral crest...

146
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,580
We need a way to hide it. There's no way
that a Saint Disciple will miss it.

147
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,580
What if she finds out?

148
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,040
You know the answer to that.

149
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,330
Worst case, astral mages found in
Empire territory are executed on the spot.

150
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,540
But in Captain's case, it's different!

151
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:37,830
It's just bad timing.

152
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:41,450
We just had an incident
with Shanorotte recently.

153
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,620
Whether we hide the crest or not,
they'll treat her as a spy once they find out.

154
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,160
If they don't find out, and hiding it is
also difficult, then it's hopeless...

155
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,950
Let's go!

156
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,080
Okay, wait for me!

157
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,200
I'm sorry...

158
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,330
Suggesting we go to Ein sounded
like we're trying to hide you.

159
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:24,700
Don't be. Right now, the Neutral city
is the only place I can be.

160
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:27,740
Besides, I feel less stressed here.

161
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,830
Having an astral crest
won't be a problem here.

162
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,200
I wonder if the Empire
was like this 100 years ago?

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,240
One hundred years ago?

164
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,910
During the time when the Empire
had dominance over the world.

165
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,450
Back then, 60% of the world's nations
were tributary states.

166
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:54,370
It must have been peaceful.

167
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:58,490
But then, the Empire discovered
the Secret of the Celestial Body.

168
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,540
An inexplicable energy called astral spirits.

169
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,830
Power so strong that ordinary people
with it were called witches and demons.

170
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,790
The Empire was just afraid of that power.

171
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,370
That fear caused oppression
among people who hosted astral spirits.

172
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:21,660
But I believe that we can still end this war.

173
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,790
The time will come when you
won't have to hide that.

174
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,580
Iska...

175
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:33,290
Nene, Jhin, and myself... We're all with you.
We'll get through this together.

176
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,700
Come on, don't make me cry.
I'm a sucker for these things.

177
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,540
Right! Well, we're already here,
so we might as well enjoy the stay!

178
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,330
I'm going to go get us something to drink.

179
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:05,080
So peaceful... People here are free from
gunshots and the smell of gun powder.

180
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,200
I wonder if peace like this will ever come
for the Nebulis Sovereignty.

181
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,830
An age where no one will be
called witches and demons...

182
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,240
The day when this war will end...

183
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,120
Captain Mismis is also a victim
in this astral crest ordeal.

184
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,580
Unless we can put an end to this war...

185
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,830
And yet...

186
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,990
You'll capture Queen Nebulis.

187
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,410
If we really succeed in capturing the queen,

188
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,120
the Empire... The Eight Great Apostles
will never free the queen.

189
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,910
It'll only fuel the war.

190
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,660
Ugh, I hate this!

191
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:01,790
Excuse me.

192
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,080
Would it be all right
if I join you on this bench?

193
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,490
Alice?

194
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,740
Huh?

195
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,700
Iska?!

196
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,290
I found you!

197
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,790
Huh? But I wasn't in hiding or anything...

198
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,740
No, you have no idea!

199
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,540
I've spent days walking around
looking for you!

200
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,580
Looking for me?

201
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,370
Never mind.

202
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,700
A-Anyway! Um...

203
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,450
Ugh, great! I had so much to say,
but now I'm drawing a blank!

204
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,660
Oh, um, okay...

205
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:03,620
Um, did you want to sit?

206
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,790
O-Of course not. You and I are enemies...

207
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,160
If Rin sees us sitting on the same bench,
she'll give me another scolding!

208
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,830
Then I'll get up.

209
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:17,540
Wait!

210
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,040
F-Fine. I'll sit, but so will you.
That way, we're equals.

211
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,290
Come on.

212
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,950
All right...

213
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:50,080
I'm glad you're okay.
I haven't seen you since that incident...

214
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,910
What are you doing here?

215
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm just pondering about something.

216
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,080
Since then, something came up on our side
as well, and it's got me stumped.

217
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,240
Huh?

218
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,040
Well, what is it? You can tell me.

219
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,790
There's no way I can tell you.

220
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,620
Don't worry, I'm good with secrets.
I only tell them to Rin.

221
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,910
You can't keep a secret at all!

222
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:19,240
Come on, we know each other.

223
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,950
Even if we're enemies?

224
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,490
We are enemies. But this is the Neutral city.
A temporary truce.

225
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,740
Come on.

226
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,870
Lady Alice.

227
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,490
R-Rin!

228
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,740
Th-Th-This isn't what it looks like!
It's nothing!

229
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,120
You seem very close for it to be nothing.

230
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,660
It's Iska's fault!

231
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,080
H-How is it my fault?!

232
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,490
So you survived, Imperial swordsman.

233
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,580
No matter. Lady Alice, I was looking for you.

234
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,950
I was wondering if you wanted to
take a break, but this is a perfect spot.

235
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,410
Thank you.

236
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,830
Huh?

237
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,450
It's yours. Think of it as a generous
offering from Lady Alice.

238
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,290
Thanks...

239
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,040
Oh, Rin. How thoughtful of you.

240
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
This is the Neutral city, after all.

241
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,370
Is it apple? It has a unique fragrance.

242
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,740
It's lemonapple.
Don't you have them in the Empire?

243
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,040
I've never heard of it.

244
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,910
Come to think of it, Captain's been gone
for a while. I wonder if she's okay?

245
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:49,580
Iska, you were just thinking about something.

246
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,870
It's a secret...

247
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,080
Iska?

248
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,160
Iska, what's wrong?

249
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,080
Iska...?

250
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,660
Lady Alice, I must apologize.

251
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,160
I spiked his drink with a sleep-inducing drug.

252
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,910
What? Rin, this is the Neutral city...!

253
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,040
I-It's not what you think, Lady Alice.

254
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,370
I never imagined he would drink
something I provided!

255
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,450
Then why?

256
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:29,580
"The Sovereignty tried to drug me."

257
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:32,160
That fact alone would have been enough.

258
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,330
I figured he would view you as dangerous
and stop speaking to you so freely.

259
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,290
This is unexpected. I should've spiked it
with a deadly poison instead...

260
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,330
Rin.

261
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,490
Jeez, Rin! How could you do this?!
I don't like this at all!

262
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,700
There is only one thing to do.
Take him into custody.

263
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,290
What?

264
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:06,740
H-Hold on, Rin. Take him into custody?

265
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,490
Iska?

266
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:19,050
Isk--

267
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,950
Don't make a scene!

268
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,790
This swordsman is the enemy
of the Sovereignty. We're taking him in.

269
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,830
What did you do to Iska?!

270
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,990
How dare you do such a thing at Neutral city!
Is this how you all operate?!

271
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,290
I don't intend on explaining.

272
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:40,200
G-Give Iska back!

273
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,240
Freeze!

274
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,450
Rin, let's go.

275
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:07,120
It looks like Iska, the Successor of
the Black Steel, has been kidnapped

276
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,490
by the Ice Calamity Witch.

277
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,990
What would you like for us to do, Emperor?

278
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,990
Paradise:
Rin's Big Miscalculation
